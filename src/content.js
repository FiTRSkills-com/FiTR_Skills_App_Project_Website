Employers can create employment opportunities through two ways: a general list of skills they are interested in, as well as through a specified job post with a set of desired skills. Once set, these skills all congregate into a pool of in-demand skills associated with a location set by the employer or specified  by the job post."+
    " Candidates then are able to go through these pools of in-demand skills based on the locations they select, and select the skills they are capable of. After a certain percentage of capability is met, set by the employer, the job is added to a list of recommended jobs the candidate may then express interest in. Employers may then look through candidates who have shown interest, or other candidates in the area "+

This project's aim is to build upon the current development of the system to its MVP. Future expansion of this project includes but not limited to, building upon the skills framework, providing a web app for candidates, providing an "+
    "android app for candidates and investigating / building a skills certification platform for educators. These future expansions are currently prioritized in order based on early conversations with the project sponsor Jeff Kerns, but future conversations are important in order to more accurately define and prioritize these expansions."
